# measure quantify the level of synchrony in a large population of neurons within an Erdos-Renyi network.
measure quantify the level of synchrony in a large population of neurons within an Erdos-Renyi network.


For measure the level of synchrony we must pass 5 steps.


Step number  | work done | language used | outputs
:-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------:
first step  | Making an Erdos-Renyi network with Hodgkin-Huxley model | C++| temp.txt-datas.txt bineryprint.txt
second step  |3D visualization of Erdos-Renyi Network | python| Programming language used
Third step  | plotting how neurons connect to each other in the network in a binary way | python| Programming language used
fourth step  | Calculating the spike train and draw the raster plot | MATLAB| Programming language used
fifth step  | Calculate the overall synchronization of the network | C++| Programming language used
